It's Not Pacman
Alpha Release 0.3
Covers most basic gameplay.  One mode of play, no instructions.
This is a minimum working model release.

Introduction: Some ideas:

Talked with K, here's some ideas:
 - You're on the edge of satisfying or addictive.  Need to make levels complete and return to the menu.  The reoccuring new levels is a problem.
 - Make the animations and effects less frantic.  More chill.
 - Needs to have music and sound, just like you envision.


TODO List
 - Features:
 - Create workable menu objects.
 - Organize a standard flow for updating objects and drawing objects.
 - Make a level editor, and a file format for mazes.  Also, a way to wrap mazes into a playlist thingy.

 - Completed: done: Maze rendering to image
              done: Only draw maze on resize and new level.
              done: Clean up the pathfinding algorithm. (It's the bottleneck)
              done: rework redundant code
              done: Organize timers into a single game loop
              done: Create a game object to hold global junk.
              done: split up the rendering loop.
              done: Remove vec2d object and cell object.

 - Known Bugs: When entering a new level, the first piece of gold is not picked up.
